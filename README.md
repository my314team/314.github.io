# Time and [Crypto Revolution]

Whitepaper v0.2:

Time and Crypto Project

Dear all,

I am excited to introduce a new project that aims to revolutionize the way we think about time and cryptocurrency. The project is an app that helps individuals and groups manage their screen-time and application usage, and earn cryptocurrency by completing certain tasks or activities.

The app integrates with various third-party services and apps, including Google Family Link, to track screen-time, location history, and app usage data. This information is used to trigger the mining process and incentivize productive activities that benefit the ecosystem for kids and parents.

The platform will use AI management to gamify tasks and screen-time limits, and allow groups to collect points for productive activities. Users will be able to earn cryptocurrency by limiting their screen-time, completing educational tasks or quizzes, or participating in other productive activities.

To ensure transparency and accountability, all data will be recorded on the blockchain. The decentralized voting system of the platform will use a consensus mechanism such as proof of stake or proof of work, where users with a certain amount of cryptocurrency have the ability to vote on important decisions.

My ultimate goal is to create a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for kids and parents, where they can manage their screen-time and earn cryptocurrency by engaging in productive activities. This project will be started with 0 investment (was bought only this domain 314.sh), and we are looking for followers and donations.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to working with you
