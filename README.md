# Time and [Crypto Revolution]

Whitepaper v0.2:

Time and Crypto Project

Dear all,

I am excited to introduce a new project that aims to revolutionize the way we think about time and cryptocurrency. The project is an app that helps individuals and groups manage their screen-time and application usage, and earn cryptocurrency by completing certain tasks or activities.

The app integrates with various third-party services and apps, including Google Family Link, to track screen-time, location history, and app usage data. This information is used to trigger the mining process and incentivize productive activities that benefit the ecosystem for kids and parents.

The platform will use AI management to gamify tasks and screen-time limits, and allow groups to collect points for productive activities. Users will be able to earn cryptocurrency by limiting their screen-time, completing educational tasks or quizzes, or participating in other productive activities.

To ensure transparency and accountability, all data will be recorded on the blockchain. The decentralized voting system of the platform will use a consensus mechanism such as proof of stake or proof of work, where users with a certain amount of cryptocurrency have the ability to vote on important decisions.

My ultimate goal is to create a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for kids and parents, where they can manage their screen-time and earn cryptocurrency by engaging in productive activities. This project will be started with 0 investment (was bought only this domain 314.sh), and we are looking for followers and donations.

# Here's an explanation that could be understood by most people, even kids:

Imagine you have a magic wallet that can hold special digital coins called "cryptocurrency." This wallet is easy for anyone to use, no matter how much they know about digital money. It can teach you about money and help you join fun programs with a community of friends.

The wallet is friendly and speaks many languages, so everyone can understand how to use it. It also tells you how to keep your digital coins safe and how a special technology called "blockchain" works.

Now, think of magic agreements called "smart contracts." These are like computer programs that run on the blockchain and make things happen automatically when certain conditions are met. They help people trade, share, and do many other things without needing to trust a middleman.

A new project called "Time and Crypto" wants to change the way we think about time and digital coins. It's an app that helps you and your friends manage how much time you spend on screens and what apps you use. You can even earn digital coins by doing certain tasks or activities.

The app works with other services and apps, like Google Family Link, to track how much time you spend on screens, where you've been, and what apps you use. This information is used to start a process called "mining" and encourage you to do good things that help everyone.

The app will make tasks and screen-time limits more fun with a game-like system. You and your friends can earn points for doing good things, and you can even earn digital coins by spending less time on screens, doing educational tasks or quizzes, or joining other fun activities.

To make sure everything is fair and open, all the information will be stored on the blockchain. The app will use a special way of making decisions, like proof of stake or proof of work, where people with a certain amount of digital coins can vote on important things.

The goal of the project is to create a fair and helpful world for kids and parents, where you can manage your screen-time and earn digital coins by doing good things. The project starts with no money and is looking for people to support it and donate.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to working with you
