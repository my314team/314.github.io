# Time and [Crypto Revolution]

Dear all,

I am excited to introduce a new project that aims to revolutionize the way we think about time and crypto-currency. The project involves creating a blockchain-based platform that allows users to earn cryptocurrency by completing certain tasks or activities related to screen-time and application usage.

The platform will help to build orientation and make settlements without intermediaries, and will be a futuristic crypto-currency project, as a first proof-of-being-in-time and first-time currency for people who want to be independent from time, just like Bitcoin started to be independent from backing systems.

To make this project even more cutting-edge, we plan to integrate AI assistants for kids that will help manage their screen-time and provide educational content. The platform will connect kids and parents in real-time, managing their time resources, and incentivizing productive activities that benefit the ecosystem.

Users will be able to earn cryptocurrency by limiting their screen-time, completing educational tasks or quizzes, or by participating in other productive activities that benefit the ecosystem for kids and parents. The earned cryptocurrency could then be used to purchase goods and services within the ecosystem or donated to a charity fund for the benefit of children.

To track the usage and proof of being, the platform will integrate with various third-party services and apps that track screen-time and other relevant metrics. This data will be recorded on the blockchain to ensure transparency and accountability.

The decentralized voting system of the platform will use a consensus mechanism such as proof of stake or proof of work, where users with a certain amount of cryptocurrency have the ability to vote on important decisions. This will ensure that the decision-making process is fair and democratic, and that decisions are made in the best interest of the community.

I invite all who are interested to invest their time to develop this project and participate in building a strong community of like-minded individuals who are committed to building a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for kids and parents. This project will be started with 0 investment (was bought only this domain 314.sh), and we are looking for followers and donations.

As the creator of this project, I am looking for opportunities to provide services in the areas of cyber security, consulting, or partnership with anyone interested in this field. My ultimate goal is to create a cyber campus where children can learn about cybersecurity, languages, and spiritual traditions, based on cybersecurity methodology.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to working with you.

Best regards.
